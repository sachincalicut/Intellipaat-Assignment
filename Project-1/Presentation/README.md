Title: Designing a Fitness Tracking App for Elderly Users

Objective:

The objective of this project is to design an intuitive, easy-to-use, and accessible
fitness-tracking mobile application specifically tailored for the elderly population,
to promote physical activity and healthy living.

Tailoring to the Elderly Demographic:

Elderly users often have unique needs and limitations when it comes to using
digital technology. They may have visual or cognitive impairments, or they may
simply be less familiar with digital interfaces. The app's design should take these
factors into account to create an interface that is simple, intuitive, and accessible.

Promoting Physical Activity:

The primary purpose of a fitness tracking app is to encourage users to stay
active. The app should provide features that inspire motivation, such as goal
setting, progress tracking, reminders or alerts, and possibly social features for
sharing progress or challenges.

Incorporating Health Guidance:

Elderly users may have specific health considerations or restrictions. The app
could offer features to cater to this, such as low-impact exercise suggestions,
heart rate monitoring, integration with health data, or reminders for medication.

Creating an Intuitive User Experience:

The app should be easy to navigate and use. This includes having a clear layout,
logical flow, and features that are easy to understand and use. The design should
also be aesthetically pleasing, with appropriate use of colors, fonts, and images.

Ensuring Accessibility:

The design should adhere to accessibility guidelines to cater to users with
potential visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. This could involve
features like text-to-speech, large touch targets, high contrast for visual
elements, and more.

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly app that encourages elderly
users to track and improve their physical activity, contributing to a healthier
lifestyle. Remember to emphasize accessibility, simplicity, and ease of use in
your design.

Goals:

1.Enable visitors to explore different exhibitions, each featuring a collection
  of artwork.
2.Enable visitors to learn more about individual pieces of art, including
  details about the artwork and the artist.
3.Design an engaging interactive experience for the users.
4.Incorporate social features, such as sharing a specific artwork, liking an
  artwork, or commenting on it.
5.Ensure the platform is accessible and user-friendly to a broad audience.


Conduct a literature study with the following objectives:

1. Define the need of the project using statistics and data demonstrating the impact and scale of the domain. Prepare one
   slide presentation or a paragraph (in a presentation) explaining this point
2. Gather domain knowledge and understanding through various papers, articles, and information (reliable) websites. Prepare a report
   showcasing your learning from the literature study
3. Define the competitors based on various parameters, including the number of users or active users, downloads, popularity, etc.
4. Conduct a competitive analysis for the chosen competitors
